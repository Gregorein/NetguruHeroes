## Basics

App has been built with create-react-app for quick project setup. In the project directory you can run two requested commands:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies for the app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, if it didn't open automatically. 

## Extras

Packaged with webpack hotreload and linters. Husky and prettier weren't included, as I don't have a config for them that will suit my code style.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
Bundled and optimised bundle is ready to be served - follow console commands.

### `yarn eject`

Ejects app from `react-scripts` that have been wrapped in `react-app-rewired` to allow partial webpack config overrides without ejections.
